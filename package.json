  "description": "There are many ways to log data, but few are as easy, powerful, and free like Google Sheets.  Originally, I was developing an app to log data from a sump pump system in a basement using *.csv files.  I thought it would be neat to have the data directly sent to a Google sheet, and have the graphs automatically update, and it was easier than I expected, but I thought a few steps were poorly documented.",
